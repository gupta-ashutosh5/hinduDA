exports.sectionNews.news5 = [{"title":"\nWith factories restarting work in the past fortnight, differences over payment of wages, increments and other benefits have started cropping up across the State, and industry-related strikes have been reported. While in some cases, where unions are present, wages have been settled as part of earlier agreements despite industries attempting to reduce them, in factories where unions are not present, workers have been left to fend for themselves with very little institutional support available.So far, it is learnt that the Labour Department has received about 900 complaints pertaining to wages and retrenchment, and the same has been brought before the joint task force of industries and union representatives set up to look into these issues.At present, the focus of officials in the Labour Department is on coordinating transport for migrant workers returning home. To initiate any action, the department has to notify the March 29 notification of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs not to reduce wages or indulge in retrenchment during the lockdown period, union sources said. However, the Labour Department’s efforts to set up a helpline on non-payment of wages and retrenchment was stymied under industry pressure. An earlier order on compulsory payment of wages was also withdrawn.Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry president C.R. Janardhan said the wages of those in the MSME sector earning less than Rs. 15,000 a month have been paid, and others were taking wage cuts in slabs. Trade union sources acknowledged that MSMEs were in a precarious financial situation that might require government support, but were perplexed with some medium- and large-scale industries with deeper pockets resorting to wage cuts.Pay cutsA nearly five-decade-old precision engineering technology company in Bengaluru that supplies parts to leading aircraft makers in the world has proposed a 15-25% pay cut, citing a lack of demand. It has also proposed cuts in attendance bonus and incentives, among other things. A pharmaceutical company that operated during the lockdown has paid just about 33% of wages to workers in the lockdown period.“The problem is that where collective bargaining exists, industries are trying to bargain even on the agreed wage settlement. In industries where there is no collective bargaining, workers are in distress. Incidentally, in Karnataka just about 30% of the factories are unionised,” said M. Sathyanand, secretary, All-India Trade Union Congress, Bengaluru. Furthermore, he said that to tide over the wage crisis in the MSME sector, the Union government should include wage subsidy as part of its package of Rs. 20 lakh crore.Meanwhile, attempts to reach Labour Commissioner Shantharam over the mechanism for workers to seek redressal failed, while Labour Minister A. Shivaram Hebbar said the government would come up with plans to protect labourers this week.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news6 = [{"title":"\nWhen an 82-year-old patient was wheeled into the Chigateri District Hospital in Davangere in a critical condition on a hot afternoon earlier this month, his first point of contact was a postgraduate resident doctor on duty at the ICU.The 27-year-old final year anesthesiology student, who was on duty that day, intubated the patient who had gone into respiratory distress and started treating him. The patient was a suspected COVID-19 case and was admitted in the suspect zone of the ICU. Though the patient later tested negative, there is no denying the risk factor in such cases.Close contactResident doctors such as the anesthesiology student are often the first point of contact in many such cases. “We are under risk while intubating as the patient can fight against the insertion by gagging or other reflexes. Initially, we were doing it only wearing masks but now we have been provided face shields,” the doctor told\nThe Hindu\n. “I was posted in the ICU that has both suspected and positive zones. I am now under quarantine after a week’s duty,” said the doctor.A resident doctor from Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute who finished his COVID-19 ward duty at the Emergency and Trauma Care Centre has a wound on his nose at the point where the N95 mask sticks. “As resident doctors we are used to working in long shifts spanning 36 to 48 hours normally. But, it is suffocating to wear the personal protection equipment (PPE) continuously for six hours. This gets stretched to seven hours if we include the time spent on donning and doffing and bathing after duty. By the time we finish our shift, we are drenched in sweat. As we cannot drink water or use the washroom during our shift, most of us are experiencing dehydration, hypoxia due to decreased supply of oxygen, headache, dizziness, and fatigue due to carbon dioxide retention as well as skin rashes,” said the doctor.Resident doctors are the backbone of most medical institutions, more so during the pandemic. The Health Department has received several complaints that specialists and other senior faculties are not attending to COVID-19 patients and pass on instructions to resident doctors. Following this, the department recently issued a circular asking the medical superintendents and district surgeons to prepare a roster and ensure that specialists attend to COVID-19 patients in wards. These frontline workers are also worried over the Health Department’s recent guidelines that has done away with the 14-day institutional quarantine for healthcare workers who have worn complete PPE without any breach while treating COVID-19 patients.Quarantine worries“We are working in COVID-19 wards risking our lives. A nurse in Victoria Hospital recently tested positive despite wearing complete protection. With most infected patients being asymptomatic, there are chances we may remain asymptomatic despite being exposed to the virus. Now we are sent to quarantine only if we show symptoms. Since we now go home directly after COVID-19 duty, there is a possibility of spreading the infection to others,” said another doctor.Healthcare workers, who now feel this rule may discourage doctors from taking up COVID-19 ward duties, had appealed to the department to withdraw the circular. However, Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), said that the circular was based on the World Health Organization and government of India guidelines. He argued that a similar system was being followed in other States as well, and would be essential if the case load increased.\n"}];

Buyers are expected to make a token advance once the deal is finalised on the assurance of a full refund in case they are not satisfied after a physical visit.“Though the response during the period has been low, builders have been offering good bargains and there have been some transactions [conversion to sales]. It all depends on pricing and liking and need of the respective buyer,” he said.How it works is that a real estate agent gets in touch with the sales team of property. A virtual meeting is established first and then virtual video tour is organised.“Now there is no option. Builders are scared of becoming NPAs and want to make sales. In the future, virtual tours may become optional. It is too huge an investment for most people to rely only on virtual tours,” Mr. Ummesh added.Rahul Phondge, CBO – Residential Services at a property consultants company, said even as lockdown is gradually being lifted to aid economic recovery, both property sellers and buyers will remain wary of doing things the old way.“Real estate broking firms across the globe now rely heavily on technology to continue doing business to the backdrop of a major pandemic with no clear end in sight. Real estate is fundamentally a people business based on relationship building, but as the proliferation of social media channels proves, there is more than one way for interactions to take place,” he said.A customer’s ability to view properties from the comfort and safetyof his/her home has been a major breakthrough. For this, some real estate brokers have begun using drones to provide unique perspectives of both residential and commercial properties, he added.But not everyone agrees on the practicality of virtual tours. Anthony Raj, owner of a real estate and property management in the city, said many housing societies and apartment complexes were not letting outsiders in. “We use pre-recorded photos and videos,” he said.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news8 = [{"title":"\nThe massive reverse migration of people from urban areas to villages ever since lockdown was imposed due to COVID-19 has put focus on the Attracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture (ARYA) scheme of the Centre with several experts suggesting that time is now ideal to go for full-fledged implementation of the ambitious scheme.ARYA scheme is presently being implemented in 100 districts in the country on an experimental basis. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) took up this initiative several years ago following report by a committee of experts that looked into ways and means of wooing rural youth to agriculture and allied sectors by ensuring a dignified life for them in villages.Such a scheme had been taken up particularly in the wake of a majority of rural youth shunning agriculture and migrating to cities in search of menial jobs. The main intention of the scheme was to turn agriculture and allied sectors into attractive and profit-making proposition for the rural youth. Of course, the benefits of the scheme are not confined to rural youth alone as the country’s food and nutritional security would be taken care of if vibrancy of farming sector is ensured by attracting youth and pressure on urban areas is reduced by checking migration.Karnataka had played a crucial part in drafting this report as agricultural extension expert and the then Vice-Chancellor of University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru (UAS-B) K. Narayana Gowda headed the committee that prepared the report.Agricultural scientist S. Ayyappan, who was instrumental in constituting the committee to prepare the ARYA report as the then Director-General of ICAR, says time is now ideal for full-fledged implementation of the scheme. Pointing out that those who have migrated to villages may be left with no other choice, but to return to urban areas in search of jobs if they do not find gainful employment in villages in the next one or two months, he says immediate attention should be given to provide them the options of remunerative incomes in villages through the implementation of ARYA report.He seeks to make it clear that rural sector has immense potential for creating employment opportunities if proper infrastructure is created and training is provided to impart skills. “Rural employment is not just about mainstream farm activity. For example, farm sector needs plenty of mechanics who can repair pumpsets and various agricultural machineries. If agriculture gains vibrancy, then there will be demand for such jobs in rural areas,” he points out.Also, the agricultural season is just about to begin now and hence it is the right time to engage those who have returned to villages in farm operations so that they would get income, he feels.Echoing similar views, Dr. Gowda, the architect of the ARYA report, says that the ARYA scheme provides for imparting skill training to identified youth in various farm operations besides the facility to handhold them through various organisations in the beginning of their operations. The basic idea is to turn rural youth into agri entrepreneurs.“The committee which was formed in 2011, submitted its report in 2013 and the initial implementation of the scheme was taken up in 2015-16 in 25 districts. Presently, it is being implemented in 100 districts with a target of training 10,000 rural youth over three years in various aspects,” he says.The scheme is being implemented through Krishi Vigyan Kendras, which will in turn involve several scientific institutions as technology partners. The main intention is to instil confidence in youth that agriculture is still not only a profitable venture, but a respectable profession, he says.In this regard, his report had recommended measures to make farming an intellectually stimulating and economically rewarding activity. It had also recommended building social reputation of innovative farm youth through awards.As part of such an initiative, Dr. Gowda had even commenced a system of honouring innovative farm youth from every taluk during the annual Krishi Mela of the UAS-B. These awards have helped in not only providing social recognition to young and innovative farmers, but are also inspiring other educated youth to take to farming.\n\n\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news27 = [{"title":"\nHundreds of migrants in distress moving back to their homes in south Karnataka has thrown up a pattern often not visible — that three taluks in the neighbouring districts of Hassan and Mandya have a large number of people choosing Mumbai, rather than cities closer to home such as Mysuru and Bengaluru, to find work. This has been thetrend for over 60 years.The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the special connection the people of K.R. Pet and Nagamangala taluks in Mandya and Channarayapatna taluk in Hassan have with the commercial capital of the country. In the past 20 days, hundreds of people have travelled back to their native places there. In fact, all the COVID-19 cases reported in Hassan and most of the cases reported in Mandya have a travel history to Maharashtra.Why Mumbai?It is not clear when and why people started to move to Mumbai from these parts, which have some common features. While all three are drought-prone taluks, they also have had a long history of being exposed to travellers from across India. Melkote, a pilgrimage centre for the Srivaishnava sect in Pandavapura taluk of Mandya, and Shravanabelagola, a Jain pilgrimage centre in Channarayapatna taluk, have been visited by devotees from different places over the centuries.“There were two trains a week from Arsikere to Mumbai about 40 years ago. By then, Mumbai was attracting people from different corners of the country. With no income from the agriculture field, a few took the train to Mumbai. They took up small jobs initially and earned well. This inspired many others to follow suit,” said S.N. Ashok Kumar, a journalist and resident of Shravanabelagola.Those days there were no other cities in Karnataka to match Mumbai in terms of job opportunities. The big city offered anonymity and opportunities. The migrants started working as waiters, helpers at hotels and bakeries, attendants at lodges,\ndabbawallas\n, rickshaw pullers, insurance agents, medical representatives, and more. “If a boy goes missing for some reason, the general perception among the people around here is that he must have gone to Mumbai,” said Mr. Kumar. One can find several hundreds of people from the two districts in Mumbai, Sangli, Satara, Nashik, Andheri, Santacruz and other places. Till the lockdown was imposed, at least three private buses moved between this area and Mumbai every day.For better or worseSome of those who migrated to Mumbai started off with meagre incomes, started their own business later, and even built houses in Mumbai. A woman, who has been quarantined after she returned to Channarayapatna, told\nThe Hindu\nthat her father-in-law had moved to Mumbai 40 years ago. He started working at a bakery and eventually started his own snack-making unit. Now his children look after the business. “We have a house in Mumbai and many people work at our unit.”Many have brought back money and invested it on land and built houses. “Mumbai is a colourful city. It does not disappoint anyone who goes there seeking a job,” said Ramesh, a hotelier in Mumbai.On the other hand, there are also hundreds staying in slums without proper accommodation. Many run roadside eateries. “We spend most of our time outside and go home only to sleep. We were the worst-hit during the lockdown,with no alternative source of income, and started to leave either by walking or by pooling money to get a transport facility,” said a returnee quarantined in Hassan.The story of these areas having a special connection with Mumbai also has a dark side. Among the HIV-infected people in Hassan, the most are from Channarayapatna taluk. Health workers feel that the Mumbai connection could be among the factors contributing to this worrying fact.On voters’ listHowever, a majority of these migrants have retained their names on the voters’ list at their native place. They do not miss the elections. In fact, K.C. Narayana Gowda, MLA for K.R. Pet, who is the Minister for Horticulture and Sericulture and is in charge of Mandya district, has business establishments in Mumbai.\n"}];

The banyan trees are standing near the Police Community Hall, Pandeshwar Head Post Office and Old Port Employees Apartment.A senior freelancer said that he was surprised to see the concrete road being constructed avoiding the three trees. Not many people are using the road at present in view of the construction work; but he saw them on the way back from Pandeshwar Post Office. Though the trees appear to have been spared for now, there is no guarantee that they would remain there for ever, he felt. Rosario Church Road further connects Hoige Bazaar and Bolara and was being used by fish transporting vehicles from Old Bunder Fishing Harbour to neighbouring Kasargod via Mahakalipadpu Railway Level Crossing.

exports.sectionNews.news32 = [{"title":"\nBack in their villages due to lockdown, some youngsters from the coastal belt who deserted farming in search of greener pastures in cities are now showing interest in returning to the roots.Progressive and award-winning farmer Prabhakara Mayya of Nada village, Belthnagady taluk, Dakshina Kannada, was in Belthangady recently to guide some youths on integrated farming.“Like-minded youth had invited me,” he told\nThe Hindu\nand added that at least 20 youths from different parts of Dakshina Kannada have consulted him after lockdown on taking up integrated farming. “I still continue to get calls.” The youths are mainly those who were earning a meagre income in cities such as Bengaluru. They had small land holdings in their native places, yet discontinued family farming and went in search of jobs to earn more. But the impact of COVID-19 has made them to rethink on returning to cities, he said. “Area under paddy in Nada village will go up by at least 50 acres in this coming kharif,” he said adding that judging by the inquisitiveness of those who have returned, an additional 500 acres are likely to come under paddy alone in Dakshina Kannada this year.Ravish Hegde, general manager, Totagars’ Cooperative Sale Society, Sirsi, said that the society has been getting calls from some city-returned youths seeking employment in the society’s various units in Uttara Kannada. “These youths are ready to work in the society for low salary,” he said adding that the society got at least 10 enquires for job since mid-April. H. Kempe Gowda, Joint Director, Department of Agriculture, Udupi, said that the demand for paddy seeds in Udupi district is increasing. The department sold 900 quintals of seeds by the first week of May. In addition, it is expecting demand for an additional 1,500 quintals of seeds for this kharif. It had sold 2,200 quintals of seeds in Udupi in last kharif.“Usually the department was selling the first batch of seeds by mid-May. But this year, it has been sold in advance giving scope for speculation,” he said. The increase in demand could be due to two factors. Either more persons have come forward for paddy cultivation or those who could not take up its cultivation due to flood and heavy rains last year have now placed the demand for seeds. A new group could have also taken to farming. It would take some more days to get clarity on the latter, he said.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news33 = [{"title":"\nCan the State Forest Department’s long-running forestry scheme help farmers supplement their income to tide over economic distress? The experience seems to be encouraging and for farmers with small to medium size land holdings, the Krushi Aranya Protsaha Yojane (KAPY) holds promise of a sizeable income spread over three years.Introduced in 2011-12, the scheme has twin benefits — supplementing farmers’ income and shoring up green cover as it entails upon the farmer to protect the saplings for three years to receive the cash incentive. In Mysuru territorial division alone, more than 4 lakh seedlings have been distributed to farmers in the last three years and 1,110 beneficiaries have received Rs. 1.05 crore over three years.K.C. Prashanthkumar, DCF, Mysuru territorial division, told\nThe Hindu\nthat this year, nearly 1 million saplings are ready for distribution and farmers have started placing orders as this is the ideal season to plant them. There has been good pre-monsoon rain across the State and early summer showers which have increased moisture content in the soil and the freshly planted saplings will not require much water. With the southwest monsoon just a few weeks away, the time is ideal for planting.As per the programme, the incentive is restricted to 400 seedlings per hectare, which means a farmer can earn Rs. 40,000 per hectare over three years in case the saplings are planted on the farm land. Even if a portion of the landholding is set aside for tree plantation, then there is scope to shore up income through protecting the seeds and saplings, said Mr. Prashanthkumar.Once the saplings are planted, the Forest Department staff verify the status and release Rs. 30 per surviving seedling during the first two years and Rs. 40 in the third year. The incentive is substantial when farmers plant more seedlings. “Apart from incentive, the farmers derive additional revenue for the timber value of mature trees after a few years,” said Mr. Prashanthkumar. Fruits, seeds, fodder, and firewood are additional benefits.Given the cash incentive, the survival rates are high and this helps increase the green cover of the region. The department has more than 30 species of saplings but hebbevu, teak, mahogany, sandal, and honge are in high demand.In a bid to shore up the city’s green cover, the department will take up plantation of saplings across the city. The plan is to cover 70 km of road length with 300 saplings per km. This is in addition to planting saplings in vacant lands of government offices and educational institutions. The urban forest scheme will be expanded to include unmaintained parks and open spaces.\n"}];

Madhuswamy(in picture)attracted much criticism after he verbally abused a woman representing a farmers’ organisation who raised the issue of encroachment of a lake in Kolar. A video that went viral showed the Minister flying off the handle as the woman persistently questioned him on the state of the lake. Apart from farmers’ groups and Opposition leaders, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa himself said his Cabinet colleague’s behaviour was “unbecoming of a Minister”. The Minister finally rendered a half-hearted apology, saying that he was sorry if he hurt any sentiments.This is the second instance of Mr. Madhuswamy displaying anger in public against those who dared question him. Last year, the Kuruba community was up in arms after his altercation with the Kanaka Peetha pontiff Eshwaranandapuri Swami during a peace meeting. The controversy arose over the naming of a circle in Huliyar in Tumakuru district after saint Kanakadasa. Back then, even though the Chief Minister apologised to the community for the Minister’s behaviour, Mr. Madhuswamy himself was unrepentant.Publicity comes firstPeople’s representatives have been distributing food kits, sanitisers, masks and other material to people hit by the lockdown. While some are doing this work without seeking publicity, others make sure cameras follow them every time they step out to distribute aid.In Hassan, supporters of MLA Preetham J. Gowda provided sanitiser bottles with metal stands to hold them(in picture)to government offices and a few other places in the city. All these stands carried a poster of the MLA. In fact, the MLA’s portrait is so huge that one can miss the tiny sanitiser bottle placed close to it. Leaders of the Janata Dal (S) have alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party supporters were engaging in publicity stunts even during the COVID-19 crisis.Praise for policeState BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel(in picture), in a video clip posted on a WhatsApp group in Mangaluru on May 21, was all praise for a police officer in Sagar, Shivamogga district, for filing an FIR case against Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi. The case was related to a tweet on the use of the PM CARES fund to take up COVID-19 relief works. Claiming that Ms. Gandhi had made “baseless allegations” against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa not to withdraw the case.Interestingly, a Congress delegation that met Mr. Yediyurappa claimed that the Chief Minister was amenable to the idea of taking action against the police officer who had booked the case.In a counter to Mr. Kateel, Congress leader and former Minister B. Ramanath Rai argued that “at least 100 FIRs” could be filed against Mr. Kateel as he is known for making provocative speeches.In 2017, again in a widely circulated video clip, Mr. Kateel had taken a police officer attached to the Mangaluru East station to task for the delay in the release of BJP activists during the ‘Mangaluru chalo’ bike rally.S.
