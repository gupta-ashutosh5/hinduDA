From handling 500 aircraft movements a day, now the airport will see fewer flights. The number of incoming flights has been limited to 25 a day, with minimum number of flights from Maharashtra and Gujarat owing to the high number of cases. There won't be any restriction on the number of departure movements, officials said.Asymptomatic passengers landing in Tamil Nadu airports will have to be on home quarantine and if they don’t have a residence here, they will be sent for institutional quarantine at designated hotels, the State government said in a release. If they develop symptoms, they should report to the district call centre (1077) or a government hospital and will be isolated and taken for testing. Passengers who enter the State will be stamped with “quarantine” seal with date in an indelible ink, the release said.Those passengers who don’t have the TN e-pass cannot enter the State. So they must book on the portal before landing here. For a few days, an e-pass desk will be arranged at the airport itself. Passengers who arrive can arrange pick up vehicles that can enter with driver plus one person. Prepaid taxis will be present at the airport for incoming passengers and will be disinfected after each use.Officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI) said flight services will begin around 5 a.m. and go on till nearly 11 p.m.. Departing passengers will have to go through temperature checks at the entry point of the terminal. “We had a discussion with the officials of the State government on Sunday morning and spoke about the testing and quarantine procedures for passengers who arrive from various States,” an official said.The terminals were disinfected and AAI held a meeting with airline and CISF staff. For the first few days, there may be confusion over the procedures, sources said.“From placing sanitisers to seating arrangements, we have done everything that a passenger needs. Also, there are AAI staff present in case a passenger needs anything at the terminal,” another official added.\n"}];

Congress is the other party, whose rule in the State lasted for over 20 years without a break.On May 16, 2011, the AIADMK returned to power and Jayalalithaa was sworn in as Chief Minister for the fourth time. After retaining power in the May 2016 Assembly elections, Jayalalithaa again became Chief Minister for the sixth time on May 23. The present House has one more year of its term left. After the death of Jayalalithaa in December 2016, O. Panneerselvam became Chief Minister for the third time and held the post till February 15, 2017. Since then, Edappadi K. Palaniswami has been at the helm of affairs. Even though the party’s founder M.G. Ramachandran was Chief Minister between June 1977 and December 1987, there was a break in his spell as the State was under President’s rule between February and June 1980.In March-April 1946 Assembly elections, the Congress captured power and its rule lasted till March 1967, when it was dislodged by the DMK. Between 1946 and 1952, the State had three Chief Ministers - T. Prakasam, Omandur P. Ramaswami Reddiar and P.S. Kumaraswami Raja. The first Assembly elections, post-Independence, which took place in February 1952, saw the Congress managing to hold on to power and it had three Chief Ministers in the next 15 years - C Rajagopalachari, popularly called Rajaji, K. Kamaraj and M. BakthavatsalamThe DMK, which succeeded the Congress in March 1967, was in office till January 1976. In the intervening period, the State went to Assembly polls in March 1971. The party had two Chief Ministers – C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi.Between 1989 and 2011, neither the DMK nor the AIADMK could retain power. This trend was broken by the latter in 2016.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news4 = [{"title":"\nThe Integral Coach Factory (ICF) here that was tasked with manufacturing 720 coaches for operating 45 Vande Bharat Express trains across the country in December 2019 is yet to finalise tenders and award work for commencing the ambitious project.The ongoing coronavirus lockdown is expected to further delay the project since railways’ coach-making factories are shut. The Railway Board has confirmed that the 45-day lockdown has caused 12.5% loss of annual production capacity in workshops/production units.Post-lockdown, business would not be as usual, taking safety aspects like physical distancing into account, say ICF officials. The focus would initially be on clearing the huge backlog of periodic overhauling of passenger train coaches. It was unlikely that the factory would be able to achieve even half the target set for making coaches for Vande Bharat trains this fiscal, they said.Train18, India’s first semi-high speed train built by ICF in a record 18-month time in 2018 and flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Vande Bharat Express between Delhi and Varanasi, is celebrated as the most successful initiative of the Make in India initiative.The success of the project triggered a turf war between the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering departments on the ownership of the train resulting in allegations of compromise on safety, procedural flaws and one company being favoured. This led to a vigilance enquiry and transferring out of top officials of Team Train18. The Railway Board sent the design back to the drawing board for safety clearances even as Train18 ran without any issue.Project restoredA proposal to import the complete train sets from foreign manufacturers evoked stiff resistance from political parties, senior officials and other stake holders who questioned the reasoning behind going global when there was indigenous technology in-house. The Ministry of Railways finally ordered the ICF to manufacture 720 train sets – 45 rakes of Vande Bharat Express trains – in December 2019.“The tenders are yet to be finalised. We have issued a corrigendum in April with some modifications to the tender specifications and the last date for closing tender is now July 10, 2020. The process of opening tender, scrutiny and award of work for procuring propulsion system electrics and rolling out train sets will take at least two or three months after that,” a senior railway official told\nThe Hindu\n.The factory has been shut since March 25 in view of the lockdown and only 33% of the administration staff were working. Even in the event of the production commencing post lockdown, the pace of work would be slow due to physical distancing and other safety norms, the official said.Revised targetThe official said that in the revised coach production programme issued on May 1, 2020, the Ministry had set ICF a target of making 240 coaches (15 Vande Bharat rakes) and 3,024 Linke Hofman Busch coaches for Tejas, Garibrath, Deen Dayalu and other express trains. However, the target is subject to revision as the production capabilities in compliance with the COVID-19 safety protocol would be known later this year, he said. In a related development, railway sources said that the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet had approved the appointment of ICF’s Principal Chief Mechanical Engineer Anil Kumar Kathpal as Additional Member of the Railway Board. However, the promotion was denied on the grounds that a vigilance enquiry was pending against him and the matter was sent back to the ACC, the sources added.Attempts were made by\nThe Hindu\nto get the views of the General Manager, ICF, through the Senior Public Relations Officer, but there was no response.\n"}];

It further said that employees residing in containment zones were not allowed to come to work, and those aged above 55 should avoid reporting for duty.R. Selvam, secretary of Thirumudivakkam Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association, said that over 1,500 migrant workers, mainly from Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra, had left for their home towns. “Staff and skilled workers from down south didn't return to work due to the transportation issue and the fear of contracting COVID-19,” he said.‘Many have left’The same was the case in other industrial estates in and around Chennai. When asked about the immediate challenge they were facing, Bakul M. Patel, president, SIDCO Industrial Estate Villivakkam Manufacturers’ Association, said many migrant workers had already left the city. “The rest have requested permission to go home as and when they get trains and buses. We are wondering how to pay salaries this month. We have tougher days ahead,” he said.The MSMEs said that their order books were empty, and even if they open their units, they would have to wait for their clients to come back to them. “When we start operations, we won't have enough hands to help us with production, as 50% of our workers have left. We are not certain about the demand. Orders have declined from auto OEMs, and we don’t know what they have decided to do. And, the stimulus package has not been helpful,” said A.N. Sujeesh, president, Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association.“There are no new orders coming in, and even if we get some, we are short of workers,” said, K.V. Kanakambaram, president, The Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association, Guindy.With zero billing during the months of April and May, the MSMEs have indicated that it would be difficult to pay salaries for May and June. They said the Finance Minister's announcements, made 10 days ago, will not be of any immediate help. “Whenever we go to the banks, we are told that they have not received the orders/circulars for provision of funds,” Mr. Kanakambaram said.According to the MSMEs, instead of a moratorium, the government should consider reducing the bank interest rate (repo rate +2% instead of repo+5%).To address the shortage in the workforce, the MSMEs have suggested that job fairs could be arranged in industrial estates so that local residents could get job opportunities.\n"}];

I expect a huge surge at cinemas as people are waiting to come out. We already have trained staff – we just have to reduce the contact points and make it a safe experience,” says Ms. Kalpathi.More showsDespite an expected reduction in theatre capacity, she says the revenue for producers will not be greatly reduced if the State government allows them to screen more shows. “On weekends, we operate at 80% of occupancy, and on weekdays, we operate at probably 25% occupancy. With respect to ‘big’ movies (with stars), there is a challenge.“If the government helps us and allows us to screen early morning shows, we will double the number of shows – instead of four shows, we can run eight shows. Fans will come to theatres anyway for big star films. On weekdays, occupancy will go up,” said Ms. Kalpathi.What does she think about movies releasing directly on OTT platforms?“From the multiplex point of view, we have been paying salaries without pay cuts and rent and there are fixed costs. We need movies to come to theatres as they would bring back the audience. But, from the production side, there is the interest, right? Every day the interest keeps increasing. Theatres can’t support the interest cost of producers if they are asking them to wait. So, they (producers) will have to find ways to survive,” said Ms. Kalpathi.She adds, “We see the 7 films that have managed to get an OTT release – there are 100s of films which have not. This is a unique scenario. The OTT platforms have been able to watch the film and take a call. When things go back to normal, no producer will be willing to show the film. And how will they assess the value of the film? It is based on the film’s theatrical performance. Right now, they (producers) are trying to survive. A producer is never going to get back money without a theatrical release.” The challenge, she says, will be in managing film production.“Now, everyone has to focus on pre-production more. There is so much work that needs to be done, as safety is very crucial. Even if one person is infected, we can’t shoot for three weeks. Production is going to be very, very challenging,” she says.Ms. Kalpathi, however, finds a silver lining in the lockdown as she feels that producers can finally wrest back some form of control.\n"}];

The closure of salons, a majority of which fall under the unorganised sector, had pushed hairdressers and their families into penury.For those working in the industry in Chennai, there are testing times ahead. M. Rukmangathan, secretary, Tamil Nadu Hairdressers’ Union (Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu), said there were over 20,000 shops in the two districts. But more than 5,000 shops across Chromepet, Pallavaram, Medavakkam, Tambaram, Vandalur and Peerkankarani could not be opened as they fell under the Chennai City Police limits, and the law enforcement authorities concerned had not permitted them to resume operations.The State government had announced financial assistance of Rs. 2,000 to hairdressers, including those who have not registered themselves with the Tamil Nadu Hair Dressers’ Welfare Board. But members of the Tamil Nadu Hairdressers’ Union — one of the oldest hairdressers’ unions, formed in 1954 — said they had not received the aid promised by the Chief Minister.Guna, who runs a salon in Tambaram, said that when the members of the union approached the village officials, the latter claimed that they had not received any circular about the aid.Salon operators in the districts of Tiruchi, Coimbatore and Madurai complained that they had not received the welfare assistance of Rs. 2,000 promised by the State government for members of welfare boards under the unorganised sector.“The announcement on the financial assistance was made in April, but the aid has not been provided even to hairdressers who have registered themselves with the welfare board,” said P. Dharmalingam, secretary, Tiruchi District Barbers’ Association. At least 1,050 shop owners were registered with the welfare board, he added.While hairdressers have been complaining about the non-payment of financial aid, customers say salons have not been following government norms, with many shops running with the air conditioners on. Though the government had asked them to use gloves while working, hairdressers said this was not practical, as doing so would make it difficult to trim hair to perfection.\n"}];

But TAPR uses air that has gone through multiple filters and frequent quality checks. There is no chance of contamination,” he said.Guru Shankar, Chairman, Meenakshi Hospital, said that with experts opining that COVID-19 is here to stay for a long time, the likelihood of a surgeon having to perform an elective surgery for a patient infected with Covid-19 is going to be more. “Today, healthcare professionals use N95 respirators and for a higher level of protection PAPR systems. Though PAPR is safe and reusable, there is a risk of contamination. However, TAPR guarantees 100% protection,” he said.Dr. Kesavamoorthy said that unlike PAPR that required meticulous cleaning after every procedure, TAPR required no cleaning at all. Further, TAPR can work endlessly as it did not need a battery. “PAPR is bulky because it has many components but TAPR with just an air flow regulator and a simple long tube is weightless,” he added.The statement said that the hospital did not want to patent the design.\n"}];

At least 70 % of them are migrant workers and almost 70 % of these workers have left for their home States,” he said. The remaining workers are reluctant to come to work because they want to return home whenever they are able to take a train.Another builder said they were asking the migrant workers to come for daily wages so that the workers can leave the site if their trains were confirmed. “Only with this assurance have some workers returned to the construction site,” he said.The industry employs a large number of workers from other districts of Tamil Nadu too. They had all gone home when the lockdown was announced. The construction companies are now applying for e-passes to bring back these workers.“We fear that construction costs will go up as the workers available will now ask for higher wages and we have to complete the works taken up,” one of the builders said.“I had more than 300 workers at my project site in February.

exports.sectionNews.news45 = [{"title":"\nIn yet another jolt for consumers during the pandemic, the Puducherry government has decided to increase power tariff for all sections based on the recommendations of the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC).In the last four years, the government had increased power tariff thrice putting additional burden on household spending.After increasing the power tariff in 2019, the Puducherry Electricity Department increased the power tariff by an average of 3.12% to fill the gap between revenue and expenditure while retaining the regulatory surcharge of 4% for the year 2020-21.The revised tariff, which will come into effect from June, will leave an impact on the monthly bills of over 3 lakh domestic consumers in the Union Territory of Puducherry.The average power tariff is expected to be broadly in the range of 35 paise to 40 paise a unit although it might be slightly higher for some consumer categories.The maximum hit would be to those consuming above 300 units, sources say.The Puducherry Electricity Department caters to 4.9 lakh consumers, of which 3.35 lakh are in the domestic category, 53,224 under commercial category and 6,836 agriculture connections.As per the JERC order, the rate for consumption up to 100 units (domestic service) remains unchanged at Rs. 1.50 a unit.For consumption of 101 to 200 units a month, the tariff has been increased to Rs. 2.55 a unit from Rs. 2.50 and for 201 to 300 units the charge has been increased from Rs. 4.35 a unit to Rs. 4.50 a unit.The rate of consumption above 300 units has been increased from Rs. 5.60 to Rs. 5.90 a unit. The monthly fixed charges has been fixed at Rs. 45 irrespective of units consumed.Commercial categoryIn the commercial category, for consumption of up to 100 units, the tariff has been increased from Rs. 5.50 a unit to Rs. 5.60.For consumption from 101 to 250, the charge has been increased from Rs. 6.50 a unit to Rs. 6.65. For those using above 250 units a month, the tariff has been increased from Rs. 7.20 a unit to Rs. 7.40.The monthly charges have been fixed at Rs. 130.For high tension consumers (for contracted demand of up to 5000 kva), the tariff has gone up from Rs. 5.50 a unit to Rs. 5.65 a unit.The Electricity Department had its reasons for the latest hike.The JERC fixed the tariff based on the net revenue requirement for the financial year. The revenue requirement worked out for the fiscal was around Rs. 1,653.21 crore, including Rs. 1,591.27 crore needed for power purchase. So, the gap between the revenue and expenditure was around Rs. 61.93 crore.AIADMK legislature party leader A. Anbalagan termed the hike in power tariff as the most inhuman decision.It would unleash sufferings on the people when the pandemic was gaining ground fast in the Union Territory, Mr. Anbalagan added.\n"}];

Although most wore facemasks and aprons, gloves were rarely worn. “It is difficult to comb the hair and trim correctly with gloves on. These norms are quite unreasonable,” a hairdresser said.

Over the last few weeks, the native rose has been seen blooming in parts of the Nilgiris, including parts of the Ketti Valley.Explaining the important role the\nRosa leschenaultii\nperforms in a typical Shola forest, Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a restoration ecologist from the Nilgiris said that the rose usually grows along the periphery of a native Shola forest.“The plants date back to millions of years. They grow along the margins of a forest and help to maintain the micro-climate inside the forest,” said Mr. Bosco. He added that the plants were becoming increasingly harder to spot due to the degradation of the habitats in which they are found.Conservationists said that while these unassuming plants play a crucial role in the local ecology, they do not get the same amount of protection that other types of native flora, such as a Shola tree species would receive.They said that native Shola forests in the Nilgiris comprise hundreds of different varieties of plants, trees, creepers and shrubs that work together symbiotically. They added that while the need to protect and conserve Shola tree species was often given precedence, there were hundreds of other species too that comprise native ecology and were coming under increasing threat from multiple factors including the increased rate of spread of invasive flora into the Nilgiris’ upper plateau.Titus John, a Coonoor-based photographer who documented the flowering of the plants in the Ketti Valley, recently said that the few individuals he spotted in the region were growing extremely close to tea estates and human habitations, while most individuals were surrounded by exotic or invasive plant species.“I had heard about this particular kind of rose endemic to the Nilgiris and had wanted to document it. It was quite a surprise to me that this rose, which I heard grew around Shola patches, was quite close to tea estates,” he said.\n"}];

Vasanthan, trustee of Clean Coonoor, said that the spot where the garden and the lawns now stand were once open landfill, with thousands of tonnes of waste, mostly non-biodegradable, festering for many years, not only creating an eyesore, but also serving as a foraging ground for feral dogs and wildlife, which used to visit the site regularly to feed off the scraps in the dumpyard.“This year, it was difficult to get the plants to grow properly as we had planted them on exposed land with quite intense sunlight. In the coming years, fast-growing trees will take over parts of the garden, ensuring more shade for the flowering plants to grow in,” added Mr. Vasanthan.Clean Coonoor plans to switch over to using only organic methods to grow the plants and trees in the facility in the coming years, and also begin introducing native species of flora once the quality of the soil recovers and improves.AimSamantha Iyanna, managing trustee of Clean Coonoor, said that the garden would serve to de-stigmatise the waste management facility and how residents think of garbage. “It is our ultimate goal through the garden to change the way people think about waste management and about how people can play a positive role in ensuring that our waste does not make it into ecologically sensitive areas such as forests,” said Ms. Iyanna.The efforts already seem to be paying off, with residents living around the facility now using the lawns and the gardens as a place to congregate and go for walks during the evenings, municipal officials said, adding that the garden was serving as a positive influence for local communities.\n"}];
