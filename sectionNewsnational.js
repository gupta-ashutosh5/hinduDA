We categorically deny this,” Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said, a day after reports referred to the alleged detention of Indian soldiers in three separate incidents. The spokesperson said the reports hurt “national interests”.Tensions between India and China along the LAC have been rising for the past month, since People’s Liberation Army troops tried to disrupt road construction in the Ladakh sector; dozens of soldiers have been injured in incidents of jostling and pushing in at least four points of conflict. Officials have said that the skirmishes have been caused by “differing perceptions” of the LAC, which is not fully demarcated.In three statements last week, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs alleged that Indian troops had carried out “infringement activities”, “trespassing” into Chinese-claimed territory in Sikkim and Ladakh, and even accused India of “attempting to unilaterally change the status of border control”.The Ministry of External Affairs had said that it was the PLA that had “undertaken activity hindering India’s normal patrolling patterns”.In the current standoff, incidents have been reported from three points on the LAC in Ladakh — Pangong Tso (lake), Galwan Nalah and Demchok, and one at Nakula Pass in Sikkim.According to an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an independent think tank based in Canberra, satellite images made available on Twitter showed that the Chinese build-up in Ladakh included the Galwan area inside territory patrolled by the Indian Army. The satellite images of May 22 show about 80 tents set by Chinese soldiers along the Galwan river.India too has increased infrastructure, as it completes the construction and refurbishment of the 255 km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi road near the river valley.

We are lifting the lockdown gradually. Industries, shops and offices are being opened slowly. Just like how we gradually went into the lockdown, we will gradually lift restrictions to make sure everyone is safe,” he said.Mr. Thackeray said a Central government’s team had projected that 1.25 lakh-1.5 lakh cases were likely to be detected in the State by May-end. “But, today, we have 33,786 active cases, and another 13,000 have been discharged.

Trouble started when the passengers, mostly young persons from northeastern States, refused to let several people waiting on the platform into the train.Police inaction“We did not allow the people to board the special train because of the COVID-19 threat. At that they attacked the train and broke the windowpanes with sticks and stones,” reported Renponi Kithan, one of the passengers. Her co-travellers said the police remained mute spectators as the people hurled abuse and threatened to burn the train down. They also alleged that the police beat up some of the returnees on the train instead of disciplining the violent crowd.“This happened after we had spent more than 20 hours on the train without food and water,” said Franto Tohoi, another passenger. He added that the train, which was supposed to be a direct service, was making long halts at several stations. “At this rate, we don’t know when we will reach our destinations.”Subhanan Chandra, the chief spokesperson of Northeast Frontier Railway, said the matter had been raised with officials of the East Central Railway. “It was a minor issue [which] the security personnel handled.

Amid the scuffle, someone had thrown a stone, breaking a window pane of the train. However, the train later left the station with security, he said.In the other incident, members of a group from Nagaland, who were returning home in a bus from Madhya Pradesh, said they were racially abused when they stopped in Bihar for food on Saturday. “Twelve of us had stopped by a roadside eatery when some men came up, hurled abuses and called us coronavirus,” said Mhathung Ezung, who worked at a wildlife lodge at the Pench National Park.\n"}];

Activists formed Virtual Community Volunteers Network (VCVN) by operating from remote locations. The only medium of establishing contacts among them was mobile phones. The volunteers collected information of migrants, probable date of return and counselled them on safety and precautions.“During our interactions, we came across a number of issues which threatened to spoil the unity among the villagers. Then, peace committees involving local sarpanchs, ASHA workers and volunteers took shape,” said Prashant Kumar Nayak, who heads Palli Alok Pathagar, a Balangir-based social organisation.Last week, a woman who came from Ludhiana to her village Hirapur in Bargarh district, faced opposition from fellow villagers when she insisted on staying at home instead of undergoing institutional quarantine. In the same block, a teacher posted at Jeypore returned to his village Kechhodadar. Both faced social boycott. The committee brokered peace. While the woman had to accept institutional quarantine, the teacher because of his inter-district movement remained in home quarantine.Similarly, inmates of quarantine centre at Budhpatha in Balangir district were reluctant to take food prepared by woman self-help group, members of which are from Dalit community. The situation turned ugly and the women lodged a police complaint. The peace committee members talked to all stakeholders and found a solution. The woman SHG started preparing food at the centre.Counsel inmatesAt some places, inmates of quarantine centres locked up rooms from inside not letting newcomers in. “Our volunteers counselled them,” said Saroj Barik, a lead member of VCVN.

Massive trees, hundreds in number, with trunks having a girth of several metres, have fallen all over the garden, blocking access to large parts of the campus. “We have lost nearly 1,000 trees, including some notable and rare species,” Kanad Das, scientist, Botanical Survey of India (BSI), and in charge of the Botanic Garden, said. The garden has over 13,000 trees of about 1,100 species.Rare and notableAmong the rare trees that have fallen include the only full-grown\nkalpabriksha\n(\nAdansonia digitata\n) tree in the garden, the mad tree (\nPterygota alata\nvar.\nirregularis\n), the para rubber tree (\nHevea brasiliensis\n), the Malabar chestnut (\nPachira insignis\n), the Chir pine (\nPinus roxburghii\n), and several century-old mahogany trees (\nSwietenia mahagoni\n) in the garden’s famous Mahogany Avenue.Most of these trees were introduced to the garden by British botanists in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Commercial cultivation of mahogany and rubber began in India after the species were first introduced in this garden.The cyclone also did not spare the iron fencing along the Hooghly; the brick wall along Andul Road of the Botanic Garden has suffered significant damage too.Amid all the devastation, the “Great Banyan Tree” on the western edge of garden offered the only silver lining. The tree, which has an enormous canopy, has survived with some damage. The 250-year-old tree, which predates the botanic garden, has a canopy of over 1.5 hectares. It is supported by over 4,000 prop roots.Major attractionLocated at the western edge of garden, about 10% of the Great Banyan’s prop roots have been damaged by the cyclone. The authorities managing the Botanic Garden are confident that the destroyed prop roots can either be repaired, or new roots will come up. The tree is one of the garden’s major attractions. The main trunk of the banyan tree had to be removed in 1925, after an infection was caused by a wood-rotting fungi.A.A. Mao, Director, Botanical Survey of India, who visited the garden on Saturday, said that the sort of damage that the Great Banyan Tree has suffered was expected in a cyclone of such intensity.“We are lucky that the tree had a horizontal expansion and wasn’t tall like the other trees of the botanic garden,” he said.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news26 = [{"title":"\nAs the standoff between Indian and Chinese soldiers at several points along the LAC in the “Western” or Ladakh sector and Sikkim continues, at least three facts point to why this standoff is different from past incidents that break out in the summer, say strategic experts.“Face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops do occur from time to time, and in recent years they have been more frequent as both sides have increased patrolling,” said Ashok Kantha, Director of the Institute of Chinese Studies, who served as Ambassador to Beijing from 2014 to 2016. “Even so, the current standoff and recent incursions appear to be different from the past, as Chinese troops have shown more aggression, engaged in physical skirmishes and disregarded agreed protocols,” he said.In fact, the numbers of Chinese soldiers at each point of recent confrontations, including three points in Ladakh or the “Western sector” and at Nakula Pass in Sikkim, have been a factor of some concern. Officials have spoken of soldiers being outnumbered when normal patrols with the strength of a few dozen each on the Indian side have run into Chinese forces that number in hundreds.The second difference from the past is the levels of aggression shown by the Chinese side, which include violence that has left at least 70 Indian soldiers injured, including some who needed to be flown out for treatment (injuries received by the Chinese side have not been reported on). More Chinese boats have been observed patrolling the Pangong Tso (lake) while the PLA has dug in tents and trenches, according to sources.The third point of concern is the number of points, including those in “previously uncontested” areas which have opened up since April. “They have reportedly pushed into a new area, Galwan river valley, where the LAC was not disputed, pitched tents and dug in with reinforcement ... The fact that there have been incursions at multiple locations is worrisome,” Mr. Kantha said.Significantly, China’s Foreign Ministry has also accused India of “attempting to unilaterally change the situation on the ground”.Another point of concern for diplomats has been whether the modified Chinese patterns reflect a tactical push, or beyond that, are driven by its ambitions on a strategic level. In particular, the actions are seen as an attempt to push back Indian troops in Ladakh, where infrastructure has been improved considerably in the last decade.“One cannot discount that [Chinese] actions are guided by concerns regarding the Indian UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh,” said Gautam Bambawale, former Ambassador to Bhutan, Pakistan and China, who also had earlier handled the “East Asia” or China desk.In addition, rising U.S.-China tensions may have placed Beijing in a defensive position, and the PLA’s aggression may mean China is “signalling” that growing Indo-U.S. strategic ties do not diminish the risks India faces along the 3,488-km boundary with China.Most experts also agree that as long as there are military and diplomatic parleys, the situation will remain under control, but a prolonged confrontation will heighten the chances of an escalation.\n"}];
