Ramakrishna, in a letter to TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy on Sunday, demanded that he dropped the proposal to auction Lord Balaji’s lands immediately.‘Why the hurry?’Mr. Ramakrishna said, at a time when the entire world was fighting against COVID-19, the TTD was trying to sell the properties hurriedly, and wanted to know what was the necessity.These lands had been donated by the devotees for religious purposes and to ensure service to the Lord, and the State government had no right to sell them hurriedly, he opined. “You and your government are hell-bent on selling ‘Andhra Pradesh’, and what urgency do you have to sell such properties,” Mr. Ramakrishna questioned the TTD Chairman.CPI(M) State secretary P. Madhu, demanding immediate halt to the sale process, said that in the year 1987 an Act was made for the TTD to protect the assets of Lord Venkateswara and, from the income on those assets, serve the devotees and pilgrims coming to the Lord’s abode. “The government’s argument that it cannot protect properties located at far-off places, and hence the decision to sell them, does not go well with the Hindu devotees,,” said Mr. Madhu.“This will deal a big blow to the sentiments of devotees and their trust in the TTD as a protector of the Lord’s properties and donations made by them,” he opined.Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan vice-chairman and BJP State vice-president S. Vishnuvardhan Reddy demanded that the YSRCP government explain if Lord Venkateswara, with such a huge reserve of funds and properties, needed Rs. 23.92 crore.‘Soft targets’“The TTD and the State government are only a protector of money and properties donated by the devotees and do not have the right to sell them. The properties of Hindu Gods have become soft targets for the government, while they do not dare to do the same with properties belonging to other faiths,” alleged the BJP leader.\n"}];

A majority of the cases at the isolation centres in the district are found to be asymptomatic. Unknowingly, infected persons may pass it on to others, endangering the lives of many,” Dr. Ravi Raju said.At a meeting with the ASHA workers and paramedical staff at the Primary Health Center at Narayanavanam, Dr. Ravi Raju instructed them to educate people about the facemask norm as a preventive measure.He said the COVID task force should rope in medical staff of the Social Preventive Medicine(SPM) department of the various medical colleges in the State for containment measures.Masks distributedMeanwhile, Dr. Ravi Raju gave away masks to those who were seen travelling on Puttur-Chennai National Highway without masks, at Narayanavanam junction, near Puttur on Sunday.Members of IMA distributed masks to about 1,000 people at various junctions on the highway in Satyavedu Assembly constituency, which registered close to 50 COVID-19 cases with Koyambedu links in the last two weeks.It was observed that a large number of people from the rural areas of the adjoining mandals of Pichatur, Nagalapuram, Nindra, Nagari and Satyavedu were not wearing face masks while travelling in share-autos and two-wheelers.“Usually, men use handkerchiefs and towels as masks, while women use their saree edges to cover their faces.

On Sunday, the total arrivals of the stocks at Madanapalle, Palamaner, Punganur and Kalikiri markets stood about 3,000 tonnes.According to information, the first quality of the tomatoes is sold at Rs. 8 a kg, while the second quality remained at Rs. 6.50 a kg. The marketing officials observed that the current pricing was very decent, during the lockdown period. Though the marriages and other auspicious functions are either postponed or performed as low-key affairs, the exports to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and northern States have slowly picked up.In Tamil Nadu, the tomato exports to the Koyambedu market was stopped last month with the spread of coronavirus across the inter-State border.However, the stocks are sent to others parts of Chennai from the markets in the Chittoor district. It was observed that tomato exports from Madanapalle to Mumbai and New Delhi had touched the lowest level due to heavy presence of red zones there.Assistant Director (Marketing) P. Gopi told\nThe Hindu\nthat the prospects of tomato growers, which remained hit during the ongoing lockdown period, gradually turned brighter with several measures of relaxation in transport and public movement.“Though the hotel and event management industries are at present affected by the lockdown, the arrival of tomato stocks to various markets in the district, particularly Madanapalle, has picked up. Despite being Sunday, we received close to 3,000 tonnes today,” the official said.Referring to the reports of huge losses being suffered by the tomato growers, the marketing official said that it was only the third quality of the product that would fetch low price to the growers. He said that a majority of the farmers of Madanapalle division had now started reaping marginal to decent profits through first and second varieties. “Coming to the third variety, it generally sells at the lowest price. In cases where such category of stocks remains unharvested, that would be left to cattle or left out,” he said.The official said that the marketing personnel from the government side would always stand by the tomato growers and intervene at the marketing yards to bring decent price for their produce. “When it comes to private markets which deal with moderate stocks, the farmers sometimes face the risk of getting exploited,” Mr. Gopi said.\n"}];

He appealed to the devotees not to get carried away by reports that “triggered confusion and hurt the sentiments of pilgrims.”“The practice of selling immovable and non-maintainable properties has been in vogue since 1974, as 129 such properties were disposed of between 1974 and 2014,” he said. It was at the board meeting on July 28, 2015, headed by the then Chairman Chadalawada Krishnamurthy that resolution No.84 was passed to form a sub-committee to study the prospects of auctioning such properties.‘Govt. has no role’The meeting on January 30, 2016, gave the nod to the sub-committee’s proposal to dispose of 50 such properties ranging between one cent and ten cents, tucked away from the mainland and thus difficult to monitor and maintain.“This board only continued the process.
