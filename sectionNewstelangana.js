Naranjan Reddy here on Sunday, following his meeting with Additional Director General of Telangana State Remote Sensing Applications Centre (TRAC) G. Sreenivasa Reddy.Stating that agriculture in Telangana would be brought on to “TRAC” from the Vaanakalam season, the minister noted that the remote sensing applications would enable the officials to list exact cultivation details of every crop since it had the ability to identify the extent of cultivation survey number-wise and crop-wise based on colours of crops.Further, the minister stated that by linking the remote sensing applications with crop cutting experiments, estimation of crop yield and production could also be known with 95% reliability. The exercise to link agriculture in Telangana with TRAC had already been set in motion as part of implementation of the comprehensive agriculture policy.According to officials of the Agriculture Department, the ADG of TRAC explained to the minister that remote sensing applications have the capability to identify the soil types and the technology would also help in recommending the fertilizer application to improve the soil fertility by linking the soil health card issuance system with the TRAC.The technology would further help the officials to recommend the type and quantity of fertilizer to be applied for improving the soil fertility based on the soil types and season and it could be done for the entire 1.6 crore acres cultivable landholding by over 56 lakh farmers in the State.The minister stated that the soil health details collected by the agriculture department every season would be linked with the remote sensing applications of TRAC. He also stated that a report would be submitted soon to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on linking the remote sensing application with the agricultural operations in the State.\n"}];

Our adventure to socialise can inadvertently kill others,” he says.Dr Srinivasa Rao also suggests that people aged above 60 years and children below 10 years are vulnerable and that they should avoid going outdoors. He advises people to report to the nearest government healthcare facility and seek services without delay if they have flu or influenza symptoms such as cough, sore throat, running nose, fever, difficulty in breathing, body pain and headache.Suggesting syndromic surveillance — surveillance of a group of symptoms of a disease —and testing to be strengthened at every level, Mr. Giridhara Babu said that loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and myalgia (muscle pain) should also be considered as symptoms of COVID-19.“Research so far shows that loss of smell or loss of taste are the first symptoms of COVID-19,” he said.District Medical and Health Offices and others working at various levels in government health network were directed to monitor Influenza-like Illness (ILI), Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) and fever cases, including patients.Officials from the Health department said that Accredited Social Health Activists and Auxiliary Nursing Midwives have been monitoring the illnesses.\n"}];

A strict enforcement of provisions of Environment Protection Act, 1986, which laid down rigorous imprisonment up to seven years for seed dealers was on cards, sources said.Against a cotton area of 54.45 lakh acres last year, the government has decided now to increase the acreage to 65 lakh acres. This was likely to spur seed companies and dealers to sell Bollgard 3 by dubious means as it appeared no different from its earlier version -- BG 2 -- which was permitted.The BG 3 was an innovation in Bt cotton as it took care of weed problem at much lower cost compared to physical labour required for weeding. But, it required spraying of glyphosate, a highly hazardous herbicide to human health and biodiversity, to manage plant growth and ripen fruit. Steps will be taken to curb indiscriminate use of glyphosate, sources added. The sale of BG 3 has grown over the years not only because of its merits but the vulnerability of BG 2 to pink bollworm pest attack. Taking this as an opportunity, the seed companies and dealers resorted to sale of BG 3 by online platforms and secret means.The cotton area had steadily increased from 42.32 lakh acres in the first year of State formation (2014-15) to 54.45 lakh acres last year. At the same time, the minimum support price of the crop also went up during the period from Rs. 4,050 a quintal to Rs. 5,450 in 2018-19 and by another Rs. 100 last year. Also, the yields increased significantly due to good rains. This raised hopes in farmers and, now, with government linking up Rytu Bandhu to 65 lakh acres of cropped area the demand for seed will go up substantially.

Earlier, the government encouraged\ndoddu rakam\nas it used to be supplied to the poor through Public Distribution System.“Farmers would have no objection to transplant\nsanna rakam\nif the government assures to procure it giving bonus. In the total paddy production\ndoddu\nvariety constitutes 90 per cent and farmers are very much used to it,” said a farmer Vidyasagar Reddy.Meanwhile, as there is adequate quantity of water in Sriramsagar Project farmers as usual every year are tilting towards undertaking cultivation of paddy in the current kharif under its ayacut and they are likely to insist on the early release of water for raising seedlings and transplantation irrespective of the government’s latest policy on crop pattern.Given the water position in SRSP, the government may not oppose the demand unlike in 2018 when it deployed hundreds of policemen in Balkonda and Armoor to disperse the farmers agitating for water release for raising seedlings and transplantation.As on today the reservoir contains 29.722 tmcft as against 6.042 tmcft this day last year. Paddy of both varieties is raised in over 3.5 lakh acres in the district and this year it would be cultivated even in more acres. Sannam rakalu is planted in 1 lakh acres and the ‘doddu’ is in the rest.In the total paddy production\ndoddu\n(coarse) variety constitutes 90 % and farmers are very much used to it.Vidyasagar Reddy,Farmer\n"}];

While the civil society took part in a big way in providing succour to woe begone workers on to the NH44 passing through former united Adilabad district, the politicians were missing as they had restricted themselves to help the poor people in towns and villages who constituted their electorate.There were exceptions like Bharatiya Janata Party State executive committee member C. Suhasini Reddy who came onto the highway and served food to the hungry and tired migrant labourers for about a week at the beginning of this month. From the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi it was Kagaznagar MLA Koneru Konappa, Mancherial MLA N. Diwakar Rao and MLC Puranam Satish who participated in feeding the labour for a brief while on the Mancherial-Chandrapur NH.Two roads, the NH 44 and the Mancherial-Chandrapur national highway, which pass through old Adilabad, are the main links connecting the south with central and north India. An estimated minimum of 3 lakh migrant workers have crossed into Maharashtra so far either on foot or on top of lorries through these roads.“Our conscience suffered a jolt on seeing groups of tired and famished workers, including women and small children walking on the NH 44, towards the end of March. They had walked all the 300 km from Hyderabad and had to go a further 400 km to reach their home in Madhya Pradesh,” recalled Bheemsari sarpanch Mayur Chandra, who was among the tens of civil society organisations and teams from Adilabad to organise food camps by the side of NH44 on Adilabad bypass which falls in Nirmal Assembly constituency represented by Forest Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy, Boath Assembly constituency represented by Rathod Bapu Rao, Adilabad Assembly constituency represented by Jogu Ramanna and the Parliamentary constituency represented by Soyam Bapu Rao of BJP.The villagers of Pipparwada, from where the border with Maharashtra is about 3 km, served food and water to the migrants until the second week of May while the team from Soma Enterprises Limited, the highway concessionaire continued to provide food till the exodus ended.“No leader has come to the highway even to check how the ‘partners in development’, as Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao termed them, are faring. They, however, were found seizing photo opportunities while donating essential commodities among the local needy, evidently because the latter comprised electorate,” a sarpanch observed as he criticised leaders for their apathy towards a human crisis.“In fact, some leaders from a national party even wanted essential commodities being distributed by civil society groups to be routed through them. Apparently, the leaders wanted all the praise for themselves without spending a penny,” a critic of the local leaders added.No leader has come to the highway even to check how the ‘partners in development’ are faring.

Working at the same place for more than two years had made the job monotonous. The cops, especially young ones are hoping that their plea for transfer would reach the top brass. Grapevine is that the top brass is disinclined to give it a thought though three Superintendents of Police held additional charge of their neighbouring districts during COVID-19 crisis while several in reserve continue to eye strategi-cally important posts. And many continue to remain in the same position for close to four years.Tablets selling like hot cakes nowadaysA thought that crossed the minds of every electronic goods shop owner was whether they will get customers post-lockdown, given the bad shape of economy.

Jeevan Reddy posted a picture on one of the social media platforms reminding Nizamabad MP Dharampuri Arvind of his poll promise on a bond paper that he would quit his post if he failed to achieve turmeric board in Nizamabad and minimum support price for turmeric and red jowar. Tagging the MP to his post, Mr. Reddy said on the occasion of Mr. Arvind’s completion of one year in office after election: “Hope you remember about the bond paper.” In response, several of the MP’s followers and critics of the ruling TRS trolled Mr. Jeevan Reddy for hours reminding the several unkept promises made by the ‘key’ leaders of TRS and sought to know as to how many times the latter had beheaded themselves as promised on the failure to keep the poll promises.Abhinay Deshpande, N.
