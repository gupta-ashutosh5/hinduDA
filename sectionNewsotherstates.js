Pardiwala and I.J. Vora said on Friday.‘Only 7,512 eligible’The court’s order came after the Vijay Rupani government said in a written reply that of the 22.5 lakh migrant workers in Gujarat, only 7,512 were registered under the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act and were eligible for a travel allowance.“Most of the migrant workers have come on their own and provisions for payment of travel and displacement allowanceswere not applicable to them,” it said.The court, in its order, said, “The State government shall ensure that migrant workers do not have to face further difficulties for the purpose of travelling to their native places. The work in this regard shall continue in the right direction.”The State government told the court that the Railways had been collecting transportation charges from workers even though travel arrangements were being made at the district level by NGOs and civil society organisations. “No migrant worker has been denied travel to his hometown on account of non-payment of travel charges,” it claimed.\n"}];

The officers had received the complaint the man misbehaved with people of the area.” However, he said officers should instead have taken him to a hospital, if he was drunk, for a medical examination, and registered a case if warranted. “Why the beating?”On April 20, a farmer died while undergoing treatment in Jabalpur, four days after he was allegedly beaten up by the police for violating lockdown orders as he was returning after feeding cattle. Whereas, On March 23, a diabetic lawyer on his way to hospital was beaten up by the police, which later claimed the incident occurred as they mistook him for a Muslim.“I am quite clear in such matters. This kind of behaviour has no place in the police. Such incidents can’t be defended,” Director General of Police Vivek Johri told\nThe Hindu\n. “If they commit mistakes, action will be taken.”‘Aberrations’Denying that the incidents of police brutalities were occurring in a series, Mr. Johri said, “These are aberrations. But, there is no question of trying to shield them. We will continue acting in such cases, set an example. But I don’t see a trend. The trend is that everyone has done their duty standing in the sun in the past two and a half months.”\n"}];

The State government has undertaken a validation exercise of all registered persons by making individual phone calls to re-ascertain whether or not they are keen to return to their native States. “This is being done in view of the fact that in the past 3-4 days around two-thirds of the industrial units in the State have commenced operations after easing of restrictions, following which the number of persons keen to travel out of Punjab has reduced considerably,” he said.The Chief Minister said that the 300th special Shramik train departed from Patiala for Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. “By Sunday night, 311 Special Shramik trains carrying more than 3.90 lakh passengers would have been sent from different districts of Punjab to various States of India, including States of southern India and the North-East,” he said.15 new casesMeanwhile, fifteen fresh COVID-19 cases surfaced on Sunday in Punjab taking the tally to 2,060.

The accused, who has at least 30 cases to his name, would allegedly commit crimes in Maharashtra and send the proceeds of the crimes to Maoists in Nepal.Nepal’s Maoist issueNepal, over the last one year, has witnessed an escalation in Maoist activities, including an attack on the office of a private telecom operator in February 2019 and string of bomb blasts in Kathmandu in May last year, the credit for which was claimed by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), led by Netra Bikram Chand. There have also been repeated indications of the Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency, joining hands with Maoists in Nepal to channel counterfeit currency and other contraband into India, which was substantiated by a 2010 Wikileaks release.According to ATS officers, the accused, Dalvir Singh Rawat (38), was arrested from near Mastakhar petrol pump in Andheri on Saturday based on a tip-off received by police inspector Daya Nayak, in-charge of the ATS’s Juhu unit. A native of Nepal with no fixed address in Mumbai, Mr. Rawat is also known as Pappu Nepali in the criminal underworld and is said to change locations often to evade arrest.“A search of Mr. Rawat’s person revealed that he was carrying a country-made pistol and three live cartridges. He was arrested and preliminary investigations against him revealed definite links with Maoists in Nepal. We also found out that he has at least 30 cases of robbery and dacoity registered against him in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane,” a senior ATS officer said.Wanted in VijaywadaThe officer said Mr. Rawat was wanted for an armed robbery in Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh in 2017, in which him and his accomplices had robbed a gold jewellery workshop and decamped with 16 kg of gold.“Mr. Rawat would often arrange for Maoists from Nepal to come to India and commit offences in various cities so that they could take the proceeds back home. He is part of a larger racket that finances the Maoist activities in Nepal, with several others involved, and we are probing this angle further,” the officer said.Based on the weapon and the ammunition seized from him, the ATS believes that Mr. Rawat had come to Mumbai with the intention of committing another robbery. The source of the arsenal is also being traced, while he is being interrogated further about his activities. The Andhra Pradesh police have been informed about his arrest, and will be seeking his custody after the ATS has finished interrogating him, sources said.Mr. Rawat would often arrange for Maoists from Nepal to come to India and commit offences in various citiesSenior ATS Officer\n"}];

Worse, they have to wait for days before the BMC helps them isolate themselves and their families or even sanitises their premises. The result: neighbours live in mortal fear of contracting the disease.Social media, in such cases, has eased their stress to an extent.Saved by the tweetsOn May 20, @Balkris23944570 tweeted, “One patient of age 60 years Mrs Vimla Devi Vishwakarma in Kandivali area has COVID-19 but no BMC office is responding as they are telling beds are not available. Please help as she is my friend’s mother.” BMC’s official Twitter handle @mybmc reached out to him two days later.Another user, @AmTheShade tweeted on May 18, “My friend’s father was found COVID-19 positive yesterday, got no help from BMC MahaGov. They somehow managed to get him hospitalised, but his family still has no clue what to do. They are not quarantined or tested; nor is the society sealed, there were three other COVID-19-positive cases in the same building and@CMOMaharashtraor@mybmcdon’t care.”Another user, @aatmanirbhar5 tweeted on Thursday, giving address of a building in Parel, “Yesterday, we found one COVID-19 case on the first floor but this floor hasn’t still been sealed by the BMC. Please take action as soon as possible.”In several such cases, Mr. Thackeray has directed health committee chairman Ameya Ghole to intervene.Asked why people have to take to Twitter to seek help, Mr. Thackeray said it was a case of fear. “Most of them are contacted (by the BMC) already, but many panic, which is natural. We have people at our centres feeling breathless and when we check, the oxygen saturation level is 99%. Also, if there’s a genuine case that needs help, we all have to do our bit. Finally, the system is the people it works with; (we do) whatever we can to help all.”‘Approach ward office’Several Mumbaikars who have developed aggravated COVID-19 symptoms have been unable to find hospital beds and ambulances, leading to fatalities. Other non-critical people, who get themselves tested in private laboratories based on prescriptions from private medical practitioners, are stumped by their positive results. They have no clue as to where they should go, and when they call a hospital in their vicinity, are told there are no beds available.The BMC admits the gap in treatment, but has its own reasons for it. Ironically, it cites its bureaucratic loop in defence: private laboratories send reports to patients as well as the BMC’s Epidemiology Cell, which then compiles those reports and sends them on to local offices, leading to a delay.“Yes, this is happening?” asked Manish Walunj, assistant municipal commissioner, L ward. “When people get tested from private labs, the lab sends the report to the patient and to BMC’s Epidemiology Cell. The cell then compiles the reports and sends them to us every day, which is why it takes some time.”Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of COVID control room and contact tracing, said, “I guess this happens because labs communicate the result directly to patient before uploading on ICMR websites or informing to BMC EPID cell. Sometimes there are fake complaints exaggerated to get SM traction. But we are trying our best to close these gaps by constantly engaging with labs. This happens a few times but it creates an information gap. Otherwise there is no reason this should happen.”Swapnaja Kshirsagar, assistant municipal commissioner of F South ward (Parel), said the patient could approach the ward office directly and get help. “We just need to see a copy and we will do what is necessary. Since most of these patients are asymptomatic, they can stay in home quarantine, if they are willing. We sanitise the premises and provide all medical help,” she said.Daksha Shah, joint executive health officer, and Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, were not available for comment.Politicians, however, say systems need to be tightened. Leader of the Opposition in the BMC, Ravi Raja said, the corporation has now started sealing only floors, not entire buildings with patients. “But how is it going to work? In my ward, there were two positive cases on one floor of a building. The BMC did not test the neighbours as they did not have symptoms. Within 10 days, cases increased from two to 19.”‘Civic body working hard'Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kirit Somaiya cut BMC officials some slack. “Civic officials are working hard, but it is the IAS officers who have made a mess of the system,” he said. “Private hospitals were allowed to close down after some of their staffers tested positive, which led to a tremendous strain on public infrastructure. Mumbai will hit 75,000 cases in June, and the city is not prepared to handle the load.”And for those who are not on Twitter, it may be doubly difficult to find help.Most of them are contacted (by the BMC) already, but many panicAaditya ThackerayCabinet Minister\n"}];

A new system of online passes was put in place and clear-cut advisories issued and widely publicised. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has since addressed a series of videoconferences with stakeholders.The State government is very concerned about the revival of the economy post-COVID-19 with its limited resources. We had already launched very attractive policies, such as the industrial policy, Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme, solar energy policy. We are pursuing the proposed investments of international companies in the State. Rajasthan Industrial Development & Investment Corporation (RIICO) and Rajasthan Financial Corporation (RFC) have extended relief to the existing borrowers by deferring their due instalments by two months. The RFC has also decided to give priority to units which are engaged in the manufacturing of COVID-19 related items. The report of the task force on restarting the economy has been received. But everything will be done after lifting of lockdown with the assessment of actual position of economy, losses incurred by different sectors and relief packages to be announced.How many industrial units and oil mills have started functioning again?About 2.5 lakh MSME units have restarted their production and about 750 of the 1,800 oil mills are operating again. There are about 548 large and mega industries in the State, of which 387 are now operational. The Chief Minister is also trying to get some external aid as loan for the revival of MSMEs in the State.How has the lockdown affected oil, cement and textile sectors?Rajasthan is indeed a leading State in these sectors. Almost all the 30 cement plants in the State are now producing at 22% to 25% capacity. The industry is trying to understand the demand side in the wake of the situation created by the pandemic. We expect that all types of industries would start running at full capacity with the support of the State government.Should Rajasthan also suspend labour laws for the next two to three years?Rajasthan is among the pioneer States which have undertaken labour laws reforms. In 2014, the government had introduced amendments in labour laws for the “ease of doing business” and to create more employment opportunities in the industrial sector.Recently, in order to achieve the dual objectives of restoring full supply of essential goods and ensuring the minimal presence of people in manufacturing and distribution facilities, a relaxation has been given in working time from 8 hours to 12 hours a day for the next three months. This is a reasonable initiative to address the labour shortage. Since it has been duly notified by the Labour Department, it will benefit both the industries as well as the employees.Do you intend to interact with the labour unions and ensure that the industrialists pay full wages to the labourers for the period of lockdown?We have received both types of reactions on the issue. The Industries Department has issued a series of advisories to instruct the Collectors, Superintendents of Police and Commissioners of Police to ask the industrialists to pay salaries to their workers for April. It was followed by an order issued by the Chairperson, State Executive Committee, under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which is legally binding on the employers.What steps are you taking for movement of labourers and students?The transportation of labourers to and from Rajasthan is a very well managed system. An online system was developed for registering the information of the people who wanted to migrate from the State and those who wanted to come. As of now, we have about 22 lakh migrants registered in the portal. Of them, 10 lakh want to move to other States and 12 lakh want to come here. Rajasthan has been a forefront State in facilitating the movement of migrants. Around 2.91 lakh migrants have been provided the bus service for intra-State and inter-State movements. The government has also issued advisories for labour migration, making it clear that no one will be allowed to move on foot and immediate transport, food and shelter will be given to the migrants.
