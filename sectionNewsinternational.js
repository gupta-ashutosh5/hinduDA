He said China was “open” to international scientific cooperation to identify the source of the novel coronavirus, but stressed that any investigation must be “free of political interference”, based on science and led by the World Health Organization.The WHO has called on Beijing to invite the UN body in to investigate the source, but Mr. Wang did not indicate if foreign scientists would be invited to come to China. “Some political figures in the U.S. rush to label the virus and politicise its origins, stigmatising China,” Mr. Wang said, adding that an investigation must “oppose any presumption of guilt”.Most scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans after emerging in China, possibly from a market in the central city of Wuhan where exotic animals were sold for meat.Governments including the U.S. and Australia have called in recent weeks for an investigation into the exact origins of the virus.Global responseChina has proposed instead that the “global response” to COVID-19 should only be assessed when the pandemic is over. WHO members on Tuesday adopted a resolution, tabled by the European Union, at the UN body’s first virtual assembly to review the international handling of the pandemic, but it does not single out China. “Aside from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, there is also a political virus spreading through the U.S.,” he said. “This political virus is the use of every opportunity to attack and smear China. Some politicians completely disregard basic facts and have fabricated too many lies targeting China, and plotted too many conspiracies.”The introduction at China’s legislature on Friday of a proposal to impose a security law in Hong Kong to suppress the semi-autonomous city’s pro-democracy movement also has drawn U.S. and world condemnation.But Mr. Wang defended the plan, saying it must be implemented “without the slightest delay”, adding that months of often-violent Hong Kong protests last year against China’s growing influence in the financial hub had “seriously endangered China’s national security”.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news2 = [{"title":"\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani vowed Sunday to speed up the release of Taliban prisoners, and said he was ready to hold peace talks with the insurgents after accepting their surprise offer of a ceasefire.The Taliban proposed a three-day truce over the Id al-Fitr holiday that marks the end of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramzan starting Sunday, which Mr. Ghani swiftly agreed to.“As a responsible government we take one more step forward — I announce that I will expedite the Taliban prisoner releases,” Mr. Ghani said in an address to the nation marking the holiday.A U.S.-Taliban deal signed in February stipulated that the Afghan government would release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners while the insurgents would free about 1,000 Afghan security force personnel. The prisoner swap is seen as a confidence-building move ahead of long-awaited talks between the government and Taliban. Kabul has so far released about 1,000 Taliban inmates while the insurgents have freed about 300 Afghan security force personnel. Mr. Ghani said a government delegation was “ready to immediately start the peace talks”. Government negotiators would be headed by Abdullah Abdullah, who also hailed the ceasefire offer.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news3 = [{"title":"\nThe Chinese virology institute at the centre of U.S. allegations that it may have been the source of the COVID-19 pandemic has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the new global contagion, its director has said.Scientists think COVID-19 originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal.But the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump and others the virus could have leaked from the facility were “pure fabrication”.In the interview filmed on May 13 but broadcast on Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre has “isolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats”. “Now we have three strains of live viruses... But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8 percent,” she said, referring to the coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19. One of their research teams, led by Professor Shi Zhengli, has been researching bat coronaviruses since 2004 and focused on the “source tracing of SARS”, the strain behind another virus outbreak nearly two decades ago.“We know that the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 is only 80% similar to that of SARS. It’s an obvious difference,” she said. “So, in Professor Shi’s past research, they didn’t pay attention to such viruses which are less similar to the SARS virus.”Chinese scientists have said that the virus first emerged at a market selling live animals in Wuhan, though officials in Beijing more recently cast doubt about its origins.\n"}];

exports.sectionNews.news4 = [{"title":"\nAs the COVID-19 spread across the United States, sweeping through low-income, densely populated communities, black and Hispanic patients died at higher rates than white patients.Crowded living conditions, poorer overall health and limited access to care have been blamed, among other factors. But a new study suggests that the disparity was particularly acute for black patients. Among those seeking medical care for COVID-19, black patients were hospitalised at nearly three times the rate of white and Hispanic patients, according to an analysis of patient records from a large health care system in Northern California.The disparity remained even after researchers took into account differences in age, sex, income and the prevalence of chronic health problems that exacerbate COVID-19, like hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. The finding suggests that black patients may have had limited access to medical care or that they postponed seeking help until later in the course of their illness, when the disease was more advanced.Needing acute careBlack patients were also far less likely than white, Hispanic or Asian patients to have been tested for the virus before going to the emergency room for care.Black patients “are coming to us later and sicker, and they’re accessing our care through the emergency department and acute care environment,” said Dr. Stephen Lockhart, the chief medical officer at Sutter Health in Sacramento and one of the authors of the new study.The study, which was peer reviewed, was published in\nHealth Affairs\n.Delayed care may give the virus more time to spread through households and neighbourhoods, Dr. Lockhart and his colleagues concluded. The delays also suggest that minority patients continue to face barriers despite California’s broad expansion of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.The new study analysed the electronic health records of 1,052 confirmed COVID-19 patients who sought care between January 1 and April 8 at Sutter Health, a health system serving 3.5 million patients in northern California.More than half of the 61 black patients who tested positive for the coronavirus were admitted to hospitals, compared with about one-quarter or fewer of the Hispanic, white and Asian patients who tested positive. Black patients were also more likely than the others to be so sick that they required treatment in an intensive care unit.Even after the investigators factored out a number of differences between patient groups, black patients were still 2.7 times more likely than others to require hospitalisation when they sought care.NY Times\n"}];

Pakistani investigators are trying to find out if the crash is attributable to a pilot error or a technical glitch.According to the report, prepared by the country’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Airbus A-320’s engines had scraped the runway thrice on the pilot’s first attempt to land, causing friction and sparks recorded by the experts.After the third impact, the pilot took the aircraft off into the air again, which officials found very strange as the crew in the cockpit did not inform the Air Traffic Control (ATC) at the Jinnah International Airport of any problem with the landing gear, The News International quoted sources as saying.\n"}];
